The solution uses a different approach that respects Haskell's immutability. Instead of trying to modify the list in place, it creates a new list with the updated values using `map`.

```haskell
modifyList :: [Int] -> [Int]
modifyList xs = map (
 x -> x * 2
) xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let originalList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let modifiedList = modifyList originalList
  print modifiedList  -- Output: [2,4,6,8,10]
```
This approach creates a new list, preserving the original list's immutability.  This is the standard and correct method for working with lists in Haskell.
